# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b

# If .. elif .. else
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")

# Short Hand If
if a > b: print("a is greater than b")

# Short Hand If ... Else
a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")
