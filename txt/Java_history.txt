In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs (which used computers
extensively for automatic phone call routing) published a book describing a new high-level
language with the simple name C, being named after another language called B (whose name
came from a language called BCPL). C became the dominant programming language in the
1980s and 1990s.

In 1985, Bjarne Stroustrup published a book describing a C-based language called C++, adding
constructs to support a style of programming known as object-oriented programming, along
with other improvements. The unusual ++ part of the name comes from ++ being an operator in
C that increases a number, so the name C++ suggests an increase or improvement over C.

In 1991, James Gosling and a team of engineers at Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle in
2010) began developing the Java language with the intent of creating a language whose
executable could be ported to different processors, with the rst public release in 1995.
<br><br>
The language had a C/C++ style and for portability reasons was designed to execute on a virtual
machine. Java was initially intended to be run on consumer appliances like interactive TVs. Web
browsers like Netscape Navigator began providing support for running Java programs within
the browser, bringing much attention to the language. The Java language continues to evolve
for the programming of traditional computers and consumer devices. Java should not be
confused with JavaScript, which is an entirely different language used for developing web
applications that was named similarly.
