//While Loop: The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}

//Example:
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}

//Do/While Loop :The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. 
//This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);

//Example:
int i = 0;
do {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}
while (i < 5);

//For Loop: When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
//Statement 1: is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
//Statement 2: defines the condition for executing the code block.
//Statement 3: is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

//Example:
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
